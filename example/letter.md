Hello {{company}} Team,

My name is Eli Gundry and I am a full stack engineer that loves all things Python and Docker! At my last position, as
a Principal Engineer at Croscon, I had to wear many hats. I was mainly a backend engineer, designing and implementing
REST APIs with Flask, but I would frequently take on devops tasks, like refining our CI pipelines or building Docker
images, and implementing frontend features in our React single page applications. Naturally, I also had input on the
planning and design aspects of some projects.

In my experience, though, being a Principal Engineer means that you have to take a larger world view of your job. When
I arrived at Croscon in 2015, the company had been been around 12 years and not a single test had been written for any
of the codebases. This frustrated me to no end, so I started beating the drum to push us towards a test driven approach.
Within 18 months, all of our new code bases had at least 85% test coverage, saving the company thousands of dollars in
the process.

Why should you consider me though? After all, I have a somewhat non-traditional background, being a no-name college drop
out. Well, I've been working in IT for close to a decade now and know that I need to work twice as hard as the next
person. I am confident that I can bring positive change to your organization and I look forward to hearing more about
this position and the business's needs!

P.S. If you want to see some of my Flask code and how I like to make applications, I co-authored a collection of
mixins/components/sensible defaults for Flask while at Croscon. I'm really proud of this library, so you should check it
out.
